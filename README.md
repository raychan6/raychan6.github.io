## [LeBron James: The New Michael Jordan?](https://github.com/raychan6/lebron-james-data-analysis)

**Question**: Can we find any interesting insights from analyzing LeBron James's stats (2003-2022)?

- Cleaned and visualized data in Python
- Game Score stat drops after playing 43 minutes in home games for Cleveland and 37 minutes in home games for Los Angeles. For Miami, there seems to be no significant difference in Game Score across minutes played or location.
- Even at age 37, LeBron's TS% was 61.8%, which is higher than much of his younger years
